# Shop TUI API

## Running the application

```
go get .
go run .
```
## Bruno collection

The directory `bruno-collection/` contains example HTTP requests that can be made to the API, using the [Bruno API Client](https://www.usebruno.com/). This allows for easy testing of the endpoints.

To use the collection, download, install, and open Bruno. Select `Collection -> Open Collection` at the top and open the `bruno-collection/` directory. You can send and modify the available example requests.

You will need a running instance of the application. The collection has a default environment file, which can be selected in the top-right. This sets the address of the test instance to localhost:8080. You can click "Configure" to change this.
